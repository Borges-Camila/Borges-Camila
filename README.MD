<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Camila Borges</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm a TripleTen student of web development, and it's a pleasure having you here. I have a law degree, but I've always been passionate about art, design and technology, and it was in 2024 that I decided to start my studies in the area.</h3>

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **React**
- 👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at my [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Borges-Camila?tab=repositories), so give it a look!

- 💬 Ask me about **JavaScript, HTML, CSS or any of my projects. And feel free to reach out to me! I'm sure we're gonna have a nice chat!**

- 📄 You can read more about my experiences at my LinkedIn linked below.

- ⚡ **Fun fact:** A total nerd here! Love manga, anime and manhwa. And, recently, I've been looking into games as well...

<h3 align="left">My Projects: </h3>

- My first project using React is an adaptation of a previous project that is already in my repositories. Besides being challenging, this project brought me a lot of knowledge and growth as a web developer. [**Around The U.S.**](https://github.com/Borges-Camila/web_project_around_react)

- A project I particularly loved working on. Where I was able to create something fun and rewarding. I intend to keep developing this project to make it even more beautiful, interactive, and functional. [**The Cat Game**](https://borges-camila.github.io/Cat_game/)

- This is a creative project that combined my passion for art and programming. One interesting feature I learned to develop was a button that allows users to download their artwork, so they can keep it saved! [**Pixel Art**](https://borges-camila.github.io/PixelArt/)
